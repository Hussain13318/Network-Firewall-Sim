# **Firewall Simulation Project**

This project is a basic firewall simulation developed for the Programming Fundamentals Lab (PF Lab). The objective of the project was to understand how firewalls operate at a fundamental level by working directly with network packets and traffic filtering.

The firewall captures network packets in real time and displays relevant packet information to the user. It also allows users to define simple firewall rules by blocking or unblocking specific ports, giving hands-on experience with traffic control and packet filtering.

The project is implemented in C++ using Npcap for packet capturing. It focuses on low-level networking concepts and provides practical exposure to how data flows through a system and how firewall rules affect network traffic.
